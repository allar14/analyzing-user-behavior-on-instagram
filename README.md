# Analyzing User Behavior on Instagram

This project was provided by HiCounselor as an opportunity to work with a diverse team located in different timezones. It was a hands-on experience with a real-world dataset from Instagram, one of the most popular social media platforms in the world, with millions of active users sharing photos, videos, and comments every day.  
The primary aim of the project was to clean and analyze the dataset to uncover useful insights into user behavior on Instagram and help businesses and individuals to achieve greater success on the platform. To reach this, Python was utilized for preprocessing and cleaning the data, while SQL was used to perform the data analysis.
